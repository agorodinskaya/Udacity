				<p>Dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) are domesticated mammals, not natural wild animals. They were originally bred from wolves.
				<br>They have been bred by humans for a long time, and were the first animals ever to be domesticated.
				<br>Today, some dogs are used as pets, others are used to help humans do their work.
				<br>They are a popular pet because they are usually playful, friendly, loyal and listen to humans.
